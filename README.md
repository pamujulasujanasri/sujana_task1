We use the dataset "KaggleV2-May-2016.csv" to perform data cleaning. We use dropna() to drop all the null values. We check if all the data types are correct, if not we covert it into the correct type. All the column headers are converted into lower case and the special characters are removed. And finally, the data has been cleaned.
